Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.\n\n## Your Shiny Application\n\nWrite a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.\nDeploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server\nShare the application link by pasting it into the text box below\nShare your server.R and ui.R code on github\nThe application must include the following:\n\n* Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)\n* Some operation on the ui input in sever.R\n* Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations\n* You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.\n* The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.\n\nThe Shiny application in question is entirely up to you. However, if you're having trouble coming up with ideas, you could start from the simple prediction algorithm done in class and build a new algorithm on one of the R datasets packages. Please make the package simple for the end user, so that they don't need a lot of your prerequisite knowledge to evaluate your application. You should emphasize a simple project given the short time frame.  \n\n### Evaluation/feedback on the above work\n\nNote: this section can only be filled out during the evaluation phase.\n\n* Use this space to provide constructive feedback to the student who submitted the work. Point out the strengths of their application, and give them advice about how it could be improved in the future.\n* Was there enough documentation on the shiny site for a user to get started using the application?\n* Did the application run as described in the documentation?\n* Was there some form of widget input (slider, textbox, radio buttons, checkbox, ...) in either ui.R or a custom web page?\n* Did server.R perform some calculations on the input in server.R?\n* Was the server calculation displayed in the html page?\n* Was the app substantively different than the very simple applications built in the class? Note, it's OK if the app is simple and based on the one presented in class, I just don't want it to be basically a carbon copy of the examples we covered. As an example, if someone simply changed the variable names, then this would not count. However, a prediction algorithm that had a similar layout would be fine.\n* Here's your opportunity to give the app +1 for being well done, or neat, or even just a solid effort.\n* If any of your grading decisions require explanation, please note your explanations here.  \n\n## Your Reproducible Pitch Presentation\n\nOK, you've made your shiny app, now it's time to make your pitch. You get 5 slides (inclusive of the title slide)  to pitch a your app. You're going to create a web page using Slidify or Rstudio Presenter with an html5 slide deck.\n\nHere's what you need\n\n1 5 slides to pitch our idea done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter\n2 Your presentation pushed to github or Rpubs\n3 A link to your github or Rpubs presentation pasted into the text box below\n\nYour presentation must satisfy the following\n\n1 It must be done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter\n2 It must be 5 pages\n3 It must be hosted on github or Rpubs\n4 It must contained some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the document\n\nNotice to publish your slidify presentation to github or Rpubs, there's the publish command. This link outlines how to do it (it's one line). \n\nhttp://slidify.org/publish.html\n\nRstudio presenter has a button to publish directly to Rpubs https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200714023-Displaying-and-Distributing-Presentations. If you are using Rpubs, put in the link to the presentation into the submission box as a http:// link not a https:// link.\n\nYou can also publish using both formats to github manually using gh-pages, though your github branch must have a .nojekyll fle and be on a branch names gh-pages. There's more on gh-pages here https://pages.github.com/  and there is a video lecture outlining how to do this.\n\n",
